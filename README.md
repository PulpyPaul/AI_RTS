# SmashBloc (v0.0.1.1)

Breaking into AI concepts can be a tricky thing. Most universities only offer AI courses to upperclassmen, keeping them shuttered behind layers of prereqs. This makes senseâ€”after all, in order to program an effective AI, it's absolutely necessary to have a rigorous understanding of data structures and algorithmic computation.

...Or is it?

SmashBloc is a real-time strategy (RTS) programmed in Unity that provides much of the groundwork for constructing an AI that can either control a unit, or control a player. It is a template to which relatively inexperienced developers can add functionality without needing to understand the systems that make the game tick.

## Prerequisites

SmashBloc is written in Unity and thus requires Unity to run. Get Unity [here](https://unity3d.com/).

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repo and open the SmashBloc folder as a Unity project.

At this point you should be able to run up the game in the editor and run it using the Play button at the top.

Currently no executable build or installer exists.
